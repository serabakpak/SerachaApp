SerachaApp is a web application I wrote for my own personal wedding website. 
Guests have the opportunity to enter a message in the RSVP section which will be posted to the Guest Book. The message will first be filtered through a profanity filtering function before being posted.

Languages/frameworks used:
- Python for filter_words.py, a profanity filtering program
- Flask, a web framework that provides you with the tools, libraries, technologies needed to build a web app
- SQL (Structured Query Language), used to communite with a database
- MySQL, one brand of database software
- Sequel Pro, a fast, user-friendly database Mac app for working with MySQL databases
- HTML/CSS for writing/designing the website

Python concepts used:
- importing/using modules
- dictionary
- function
- for loop
- list
- string parsing
